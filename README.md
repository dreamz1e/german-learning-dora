This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - for LLM generations via OpenRouter
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - required for Listening TTS (gpt-4o-mini-tts)

## Listening Exercise

The Listening task is generated by the LLM (short German transcript) and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS (`gpt-4o-mini-tts`). Users listen and transcribe, and the transcription is evaluated by the LLM.

Endpoints:

- `POST /api/ai/generate-listening` – body: `{ difficulty, topic? }`
- `POST /api/ai/tts-listening` – body: `{ transcript }` returns `audio/mPEG`
- `POST /api/ai/evaluate-listening` – body: `{ userTranscript, referenceTranscript, difficulty }`

Client:

- Page: `src/components/pages/ListeningPractice.tsx` is available via sidebar navigation ("Listening").
- Component: `src/components/exercises/ListeningExercise.tsx` manages audio playback and submission.

Notes:

- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to enable TTS. The rest of the system uses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- XP is awarded based on evaluation score, similar to Reading.
